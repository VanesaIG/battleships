# battleships

In this version of Battleships you play against the computer, which places the ships randomly. You have 50 clicks on empty sea to guess the places of all the ships. You can see your progress, how many clicks you have left and even whether you hit or sunk a ship, to the right. You may start a new game whenever you want.
